- useAuth file could use some types - is that necessary?
  - it is, that's what's giving build errors:)
  - deploy to vercel - do it in the org's account(again, build errors need to be resolved first)
- error handling must be done for all the forms gðŸ˜¬
  - [ ] ResetPassword - [this](https://www.tabnine.com/code/javascript/functions/firebase/Promise/sendPasswordResetEmail) will help, I'm sure
  - [ ] SignUpForm
- investigate useRequireAuth hook, why is it not working?
- Query & display all reports that a signed in user is allowed to see
